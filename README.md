# Database_Design-Airport_Management_System
A Database that maintains and operates CRUD operations on Airport Management System

An airport management system is a complex network of different facets of the service industry working together. Rather than just the management of flights and passengers, it encompasses various other domains. This project is an attempt to weave together all such different aspects of an airport’s operations and provide a qualified but well-researched insight into its intricate working while abstracting over the low-level details like passenger handling, in-flight practices and other external branch-offs from an airport’s day-to-day dealings. 

It performs Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations on the database system upon any changes committed. The project also has PLSQL scripts for Stored Procedures and Triggers
